    <h1>Welcome to my shop</h1>
    <p>This is my online store, Where you can find anything conecting to compiuters.</p>
    <p>In my store there are many categories that you can choose.</p>
    <p>I was inspired by myself when I needed parts of compiuters but price was so high I couldnot afford, <br>
    I started working hard and today I have my own store where teenagers are able <br>
to buy compiuter parts with good price.</p>
<p>Press button below to enter my store.</p>
