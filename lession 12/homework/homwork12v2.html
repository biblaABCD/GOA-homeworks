<h2>The E36 M3 was launched at the Paris Motor Show in October 1992 and proved a massive commercial success. Whereas the E30-based M3 had been a hardcore homologation special of limited appeal to mainstream buyers, the E36 M3 offered BMW's renowned German refinement with supercar levels of performance.</h2>

<h2>Between 1992 and 1995, nearly 29,000 E36 M3s were delivered compared to nearly 18,000 E30 M3s over the duration of its five-year production run. However, by 1995 the E36 M3 was still in its infancy and, in September of that year, an improved Evolution variant was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. At its heart was an advanced new engine enlarged from three to 3.2-litres. Additionally, a six-speed Getrag gearbox replaced the outgoing five-speed ZF unit.</h2>
